    "\n",
    "Note index 0 is used to represent the lack of a note. This could mean silence, but in the context of pitch detection it could also mean sound (non-silence) that does not contain any discernable notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Note` object contains a list of `NoteSamples` for that note, drawn from a variety of data sources and instruments."
