# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

See [the official site](http://100daysofcode.com/) for details about
the challenge, or check out [my log for round 1](
https://github.com/gavlock/100-days-of-code-log/blob/master/r1-log.md).

*This* repo contains stuff I work on for the challenge that has no
other place to live. Code that is, or becomes, a project in its own
right will be transferred to separate repos.
